Some visual effects and skill icons will be added in future update

Frozen Vanguard is a defensive skilltree mod for Outward.
First of the Primordial series focuses on element of Ice encases itself in Ice to protect from most of the attacks and then use that to annihilate anything when the time is right

*Class mechanic: Permafrost*
  Stacking buff that increases your survivability in exchange for lower damage max 5 stacks, post breakthrough abilities require this to be casted, if an ability has     "at least" in its description, it means that aditional effects happen if casted on more stacks
  
*Pre-breakthrough:*
*Frozen Grasp*
  mid range attack that builds up chill on the enemy
*Frost Lunge*
  jumping attack that inficts Slow Down on the enemy
*Brittle Icicle*
  one of the 2 sources of Permafrost, counter that costs a bit more stamina but if succesful refunds its cost and grants permafrost, also restores some stability

*Breakthrough*
-passive- *Snow Mountain*
  Permafrost stacks now also grant 2 barrier and 1 protection, but slow the player down
  |
-passive- *Agressive Winter*
  Permafrost now also increse Frost damage by 5%, but decrease other elemental damage by 5% and physical damage by 2%
  
*Post-Breakthrough*
*Heart of Ice*
  if used below 3 Permafrost cleanses pain, confusion and burning and grants 3 Permafrost stacks
  if used at or above 3 stacks heals 10 health, restores some burned health and stamina and gives Unnering read, removes 2 Permafrost stacks
  always removes Slow Down
*Frostbite*
  Teleporting attack that hits all nearby enemies before returning to activated position, deals ice damage, if the target was chilled infuses players weapons with Mystic   Ice imbue and removes the chill
*Spirits Unleashed*
  Ice explosion around the player that deals massive damage, if the target was chilled 2nd weaker explosion occurs on their location, removes Chill
  requires at least 4 Permafrost
